## Data Description

### Data Acknowledgment

The data used in this project was provided by UCLA Health DDR (De-identified Data Repository) under strict privacy and security regulations. Due to HIPAA and privacy policies, the raw data and scripts cannot be shared.

The dataset contains anonymized records related to weekly hospital admissions and bed capacity trends for the delivery ward in the OB/GYN department of Ronald Reagan Medical Center. All analyses and findings were conducted in compliance with data protection guidelines to ensure confidentiality.

### Limitations

- **Data Accessibility**: Due to HIPAA and privacy regulations set by UCLA Health, raw data, scripts, and notebooks could not be exported. There are still screenshots of the data structure and code available for observation.

- **Data Complexity**: Due to the intricate relationships between variables and possible confounding factors, models tended to overfit and consequently overperform, leading to inaccurate predictions.
