## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Model Results

## Limitations

- **Data Accessibility**: Due to HIPAA and privacy regulations set by UCLA Health, raw data, scripts, and notebooks could not be exported. There are still screenshots of the data structure and code available for observation.

- **Data Complexity**: Due to the intricate relationships between variables and possible confounding factors, models tended to overfit and consequently overperform, leading to inaccurate predictions.
